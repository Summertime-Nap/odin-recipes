    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Puff puff is a deep-fried dough. They are made from yeast dough, shaped into balls and deep-fried until golden
        brown. It has a doughnut-like texture but slightly more chewy. It is a very common snack eaten by so many
        countries but with different names and a little bit of variation in the mode of preparation.</p>
    <h2>ingridients <sub>For ten servings</sub></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups flour</li>
        <li>1¼ cups water</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons yeast</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon nutmeg</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ cup sugar + 1 teaspoon sugar for proofing the yeast</li>
        <li>enough oil for deep frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix half of a cup of warm water, 1 teaspoon of sugar and the yeast in a bowl. Cover with a lid and set aside
            until the yeast becomes bubbly. About 4-6 minutes.</li>
        <li>In another bowl, mix the dry ingredients – Flour, Sugar, Salt, and Nutmeg.</li>
        <li>Pour the proofed yeast and the remainng one cup water together with the dry ingredients and mix until the
            batter is lump-free.</li>
        <li>Cover the dough and allow it to rise for 1 hour. (The risen dough has a distinct sweet smell, which will
            make you know the dough is ready for frying)</li>
        <li>Preheat the oil in a pan deep and wide enough to accomodate the puff puff balls (about 360°F ) and scoop a
            little bit of dough and drop the batter by spoonfuls into the oil.</li>
        <li>Fry both sides until golden brown. If you are finding it hard to turn the puff puff while frying you can
            just press down the balls a little bit with your frying spoon before turning it.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat. Drain on a paper towel and enjoy while still hot or warm.</li>
    </ol>
